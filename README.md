The Odin Project Intermediate HTML and CSS: Admin-Dashboard Project

<h2>Step 1: Set Up and Planning</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Set up your HTML and CSS files with some simple dummy content, just to make sure you have everything linked correctly.</li>
    <li>Set up your Git repository (refer to past projects if you need a refresher).</li>
    <li>Download a full-resolution copy of the <a href="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png">project design file</a> and get a general idea for how you’re going to need to lay things out in your HTML document.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Step 2: Layout</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Start by writing out the HTML elements for the sidebar, header and main-content containers.</li>
    <li>In your CSS file, apply Grid properties until you have this basic layout built.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Step 3: Nesting</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Taking it one section at a time, begin nesting child elements under the parent elements in the HTML. Remember that you can keep making grid containers within grid containers.</li>
    <li>In the sidebar, use more grids to lay out the navigation and branding sections.</li>
    <li>In the header, use more grids to lay out the search bar, user info and buttons.</li>
    <li>For the main-content, use more grids to lay out the projects, announcements and trending items.</li>
    <li>Fill out some dummy content and placeholder images so you can position all of your grid items.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Step 4: Gather Assets</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Once you have your grid layout complete you can either recreate the dashboard example above or style your own design.</li>
    <li>Check out some color palettes from <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors">Tailwind</a>.</li>
    <li>All of the icons and more can be downloaded as SVGs from <a href="https://materialdesignicons.com/">Material Design Icons</a>.</li>
    <li>Choose your own fonts! The design example uses 'Roboto', which is available with Google fonts.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Step 5: Some Tips!</h2>
<ol>
    <li>When building the layout, apply background colors or borders to your containers to help you visualize your grid.</li>
    <li>It’s up to you whether to use pixels, fr units or both for your grid tracks.</li>
    <li>This project does not have to be responsive, but if you’d like to you can expand or shrink the project cards section when resizing the browser window.</li>
    <li>You don’t have to make a pixel perfect match with the design example. Consider this an opportunity to practice your CSS skills with your own designs.</li>
    <li>Don’t forget to push your finished dashboard to GitHub. Use GitHub Pages to publish it to the world!</li>
</ol>
